# Hammster Circuit

The Hammster Circuit is a ZK circuit written in [halo2](https://halo2.dev/). It takes two 8-length vector inputs of binary digits and their [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) and generates a proof that the two inputs are the claimed hamming distance away from each other.
